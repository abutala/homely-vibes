# AppleNotesBackup

Gotchas, incidents and error reference: [Logbook.md](Logbook.md).

Backs up **Apple Notes** into a dedicated **private git repo** so accidentally
deleted (or edited-away) notes are always recoverable. Each run exports every
note, mirrors the current state into the repo as one HTML file per note, commits,
and pushes. Git history is the time machine.

## One-time setup (you own this)

1. **Create the private backup repo** (never public — these are your notes):
   ```bash
   REPO="$HOME/AppleNotesBackup"          # wherever you want the backup to live
   mkdir -p "$REPO" && git -C "$REPO" init -b main
   # then create a PRIVATE GitHub remote and wire it up, e.g.:
   gh repo create <your-user>/<private-repo> --private --source "$REPO" --remote origin
   ```
2. **Point config at it.** Defaults live in `config/default.yaml` under
   `apple_notes_backup:` (see that block for every key). Override the per-host
   values in `config/local.yaml` (gitignored):
   ```yaml
   apple_notes_backup:
     backup_repo_dir: <absolute path to the repo you created above>
     git_remote: origin      # set "" to commit locally without pushing
     git_branch: main
   ```
3. **Grant Automation permission.** The first run triggers a macOS prompt:
   *"Terminal wants to control Notes."* Allow it (System Settings → Privacy &
   Security → Automation).

## Usage

```bash
# See what would be backed up — no writes, no commits (safe first run):
uv run python AppleNotesBackup/notes_backup.py --dry-run 2>&1 | tee /tmp/anb.log

# Real backup: export → mirror → commit → push:
uv run python AppleNotesBackup/notes_backup.py 2>&1 | tee /tmp/anb.log
```

On failure the script sends a **Pushover P1** ("Apple Notes backup failed") — a
silently non-running backup is worse than a noisy one.

## Recovering a deleted note

Notes live under `‹Folder›/‹slug›__‹short_id›.html`.

```bash
cd "$backup_repo_dir"    # the path you set in config

# Find commits where a note was deleted:
git log --oneline --diff-filter=D -- '**/grocery-list__*.html'

# Restore the last version before deletion (^ = the commit's parent):
git show <deleting-commit>^:MyFolder/grocery-list__ab12cd34.html > recovered.html
open recovered.html      # then copy/paste back into Notes.app
```

To browse everything as of a point in time: `git checkout <commit>` in a scratch
clone.

## Scheduling

Per repo convention, macOS scheduled jobs live in **Claude Code routines**, not in
this repo (the old `launchd` module was removed). Set up a daily routine that runs:

```bash
cd /path/to/homely_vibes && \
  uv run python AppleNotesBackup/notes_backup.py >> ~/logs/apple_notes_backup.log 2>&1
```

## Folder layout

Files mirror your **full Notes folder hierarchy**:
`‹Parent›/‹Child›/…/‹slug›__‹short_id›.html`. The exporter walks folders top-down
and recursively (`folders of folder`), threading the accumulated path — so
subfolders nest correctly and same-named folders are disambiguated by their real
parent (e.g. a top-level `Archive/` vs a nested `Work/Archive/` vs
`Projects/Archive/`).

- **Empty folders produce no directory.**
- **"Recently Deleted" is included by design** — a note you deleted but haven't
  purged (30-day window) still gets captured, adding a safety net for deletes that
  happen between runs.
