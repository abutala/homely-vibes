-- export_notes.applescript
--
-- Dumps every Apple Note to stdout as a control-char-delimited stream so the
-- Python parent can reconstruct one file per note. We go through Notes.app's
-- scripting interface (not the private NoteStore.sqlite blob format) so this
-- keeps working across macOS versions.
--
-- Output format (per note):
--   id US folderPath US name US modificationDate US attachmentCount US body RS
-- where US = ASCII 31 (unit separator), RS = ASCII 30 (record separator).
-- These control chars effectively never appear in note HTML, so the stream is
-- unambiguous even when a note body contains newlines, commas, or tabs.
-- folderPath is the FULL nested path, "/"-separated (e.g. "Archive/FB/FB-UP").
--
-- We walk folders TOP-DOWN and recursively: start at folders whose container is
-- the account (true top level), emit their notes, then recurse into
-- `folders of folder`. Reading a folder's parent via `container` errors (-1728),
-- so we only ever read downward and thread the accumulated path in.
--
-- `body` is the note as HTML (Apple's own rendering) — lossless for text,
-- lists, tables, and checklists. Attachments are reported by count only.
