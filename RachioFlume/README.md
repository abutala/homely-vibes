# Rachio-Flume Water Tracking Integration

Gotchas, incidents and error reference: [Logbook.md](Logbook.md).

A Python integration that connects Rachio irrigation controllers with Flume water monitoring devices to track zone-specific water usage and generate comprehensive reports.

## Features

- **Rachio Integration**: Monitor active zones and watering events
- **Flume Integration**: Track real-time water consumption across all devices
- **Data Correlation**: Match watering events with water usage patterns
- **Smart Hose Timer support** (`rachio_hose_client.py`, `hose_timer_processor.py`): Rachio Smart Hose Timer base stations exposed via `cloud-rest.rach.io` alongside the controller. Runs detected via `lastWateringAction` state polling; flow stats from Flume.
- **Usage Alerts** (`alert_engine.py`):
  - **Single dispatch per zone end**: One Pushover per zone end — `Rachio Zone Report` (P-2, silent) below anomaly threshold, `Rachio Zone Anomaly` (P2) above. Never both. Includes runtime, avg GPM, `(thresh X.XX)` (computed anomaly threshold), Total, and Deviation line on anomalies.
  - **Zone anomaly detection**: Per-zone baselines under `rachio_flume.alerts.zone_anomaly.zone_thresholds`, keyed by device label then zone identifier (controller: stringified `zone_number`; hose-timer: valve name). For hose timers the key may be the bare valve name **or** a `"<prefix> - <valve name>"` form (e.g. `"Z13 FS - Upper Deck Planters"`) — the suffix after `" - "` is matched against the live valve name via `resolve_hose_threshold`. Threshold formula: `avg_gpm + max(absolute_gpm, percent_above/100 × avg_gpm)`.
  - **Default flow rules** (whole-house, Flume-only): Pipe Break / High Flow / Mid Flow / Leak — P2 (emergency), at most once per day per rule. CV-based variance filter rejects spiky noise on low-flow rules.
  - **Cross-source suppression**: Controller-active OR hose-timer-active state suppresses Flume rules for `max_rule_duration + 10min` slack. Symmetric.
  - **Stale-zone monitor** (`stale_zone_checker.py`): **P2** alert if any enabled controller zone or **known hose-timer valve — connected or not** — hasn't run within `stale_zone_days` (default **15**). Widened from 10 days because 10 still fired on ordinary seasonal gaps; the wider window is what earns the emergency priority — a zone that has missed a fortnight is a real watering failure, not a blip. A disconnected valve is exactly the failure mode that stops it running, so it is never filtered out; the alert body notes `DISCONNECTED` (battery/BLE) and roster-staleness (valve dropped from the API response) as extra actionable lines. Daily dedup; hourly evaluation gate.
  - **Flume data-outage watchdog**: P2 when no water readings have landed for `flume_outage.stale_after_minutes` (default 60) — healthy meters report every minute, so a gap means the whole leak-detection stack is blind (expired auth, API outage, dead collector). Re-fires every `flume_outage.retrigger_minutes` (default 360) while stale; never suppressed by irrigation; P0 once on recovery.
  - **Rachio data-outage watchdog**: P1 when a Rachio feed stops **polling successfully** (not merely: hasn't watered). The controller feed (`last_rachio_collection`) and each hose base station (`hose::poll::<label>::last_success`) are watched independently — either API path can die alone. Fires after `rachio_outage.stale_after_minutes` (default 180 ≈ 36 failed 5-min polls); hose message flags that runs during the outage are unrecoverable (no history API). Re-fires every `rachio_outage.retrigger_minutes` (default 360); never suppressed by irrigation; P0 on recovery. Runs inside the collector, so a fully dead collector is covered instead by rfmanager's P2 fatal handler + run-one-constantly respawn.
  - **Device-offline health check**: P1 when the **controller** reports `status` OFFLINE or a **hose valve** reports disconnected, sustained for `device_offline.debounce_minutes` (default 60) — the debounce absorbs transient WiFi/BLE dropouts. Re-fires every `device_offline.retrigger_minutes` (default 1440); P0 on recovery. Observations older than the outage window are skipped (feed death belongs to the outage watchdog).
  - **Hose-valve battery health check**: P1 when a valve reports `batteryStatus` `LOW` or `REPLACE`. Rachio exposes a four-value enum — `GOOD` / `LOW` / `REPLACE` / `UNKNOWN` — and **no percentage anywhere in the API** ([getValve schema](https://rachio.readme.io/reference/valveservice_getvalve)), so there is no level to threshold and nothing to tune but the repeat cadence (`valve_battery.retrigger_minutes`, default 1440). `UNKNOWN` never fires: that is the valve saying it hasn't reported in, which is the offline check's job, and paging on it would fire on every BLE dropout. An unrecognized value logs a warning rather than paging, so a firmware that adds an enum member can't spontaneously start waking you up. No debounce (unlike `connected`, the status doesn't flap with range); stale roster rows are skipped, same as the offline check. P0 once on recovery.
  - Mute support; P0 "all clear" on active→clear transition for sustained-flow rules.
- **Synthetic Simulator** (`simulate_alerts.py`): Replay scenarios through the alert engine without hitting real APIs or Pushover; wired into `test_alert_simulation.py`. See [TESTABILITY.md](TESTABILITY.md).
- **HTML Email Report**: Daily fixed-width table (via `<pre>` monospace) covering all zones — controllers and hose valves in one unified table. Per-zone anomaly threshold + alert-session count are surfaced alongside runtime / gallons / GPM.
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Automated data collection service
- **SQLite Storage**: Persistent data storage with session tracking

## Setup

### Credentials Configuration

Add your API credentials to `config/local.yaml`:

```yaml
# Rachio API credentials. Single api_key works for both controllers and hose timers.
# `type` selects the API surface:
#   - "controller": api.rach.io/1/public/device/*    (Smart Sprinkler Controller)
#   - "hose_timer": cloud-rest.rach.io/valve/*       (Smart Hose Timer base station)
# `id` is the deviceId (controllers) or baseStationId (hose timers).
rachio:
  api_key: abc123...
  devices:
    - {id: "5d11b1a5-...", label: "Rachio-Main",       type: "controller"}
    - {id: "a632eacc-...", label: "Hose Drip Jasmine", type: "hose_timer"}

# Flume API credentials (get from https://portal.flumetech.com/#token)
flume:
  client_id: client-id...
  client_secret: client-secret...
  user_email: your-email@example.com
  password: your-password...
```

Run `uv run python RachioFlume/rfmanager.py list-devices` after setting
`api_key` to enumerate all controllers and hose-timer base stations the API
sees, then populate `devices` with the printed ids/labels.

**Note**: The credentials are sourced from `config/local.yaml` (gitignored) for security.

### Installation

From the project root directory:

```bash
uv sync
```

## Usage

All commands should be run from the RachioFlume directory.

### Recommended Workflow

1. **Start continuous data collection** (run in background)
2. **Check status** anytime to see active zones and flow rates  
3. **Generate reports** after collecting data for several days/weeks

### 🔄 Data Collection (Continuous Operation)

For best results, run the collector continuously to gather data over time:

```bash
# Start continuous collection in background (recommended)
nohup uv run python rfmanager.py collect > water_tracking.log 2>&1 &

# Or run in foreground (will stop when terminal closes)
uv run python rfmanager.py collect

# Custom collection intervals
uv run python rfmanager.py collect --interval 120    # Every 2 minutes
uv run python rfmanager.py collect --interval 600    # Every 10 minutes (default: 300)
```

**💡 Pro Tip**: Let the collector run for at least a week before tuning zone thresholds — needs a distribution of runs per zone to be meaningful.

### 📊 System Status (Check Anytime)

```bash
# See current active zone and real-time usage rate
uv run python rfmanager.py status
```

Example output:
```
==================================================
WATER TRACKING SYSTEM STATUS
==================================================
Active Zone: #11 - Z11 BB - Outer Perim
Current Usage Rate: 6.14 GPM
Recent Sessions (24h): 15
Last Rachio Collection: 2023-07-15T10:30:00
Last Flume Collection: 2023-07-15T10:35:00
==================================================
```

### 📈 Reports (After Data Collection)

Generate comprehensive reports once you have collected data:

```bash
# Generate period report (default: last 7 days)
uv run python rfmanager.py report

# Custom period report with specific end date and lookback days
uv run python rfmanager.py report --end-date 2023-07-15 --lookback 14

# Send report via HTML email
uv run python rfmanager.py report --email

# Raw data report with 5-minute intervals (Flume-only, no Rachio context)
uv run python rfmanager.py raw --hours 48
```

### 🚨 Usage Alerts

The collector evaluates two independent alert paths each polling cycle.
Config lives under `rachio_flume.alerts` in `config/default.yaml`,
overridable per-house in `config/local.yaml`. The block is split by scope:

- **`zone_anomaly`** — per-zone anomaly check (Rachio-sourced; fires at run end).
  Holds `threshold_mode`, `absolute_gpm`, `percent_above`, `min_runtime_minutes`,
  and `zone_thresholds`. Computes `threshold = avg_gpm + max(absolute_gpm, percent_above/100 × avg_gpm)`.
- **`default_flow_rules`** — whole-house sustained-flow rules (Flume only, no
  Rachio context). Pipe Break, High Flow, Mid Flow, Leak. Suppressed while any
  Rachio activity (controller OR hose-timer) is recent.
- **`stale_zone_days`** — threshold for the stale-zone monitor (P2).
- **`valve_battery.retrigger_minutes`** — how often the hose-valve battery
  alert repeats itself while the battery is still low.

Key behaviors:

- **One Pushover per zone end** — `_send_zone_outcome` on both AlertEngine and
  HoseTimerProcessor picks `(title, priority)` based on whether measured flow
  exceeds the anomaly threshold. Either `Rachio Zone Report` (P-2) OR
  `Rachio Zone Anomaly` (P2). Never both. Anomaly variant adds a
  `Deviation: +X.XX GPM (Y%)` line. Both variants include `Total: N.N gal`.
- **Unified threshold value** — the `(thresh X.XX)` shown on every zone-end
  report is the computed anomaly trigger value, matching what actually fires.
- **Sustained-flow rules fire at P2** (emergency — retries until acked), at
  most once per day per rule. P-0 "all clear" on transition active → clear.
- **Detector logic for sustained-flow rules** — implemented in
  [`AlertEngine._rule_matches`](alert_engine.py). A rule fires when the trailing
  `duration_minutes` window passes both a mean test and a CV variance gate.
  Rationale and the tuning history: [Logbook.md](Logbook.md).
- **Cross-source suppression** — controller-active OR hose-timer-active state
  suppresses Flume `default_flow_rules` for `max_rule_duration + 10min`
  slack. Symmetric. HoseTimerProcessor writes `alert::__hose__::last_active`;
  AlertEngine reads it.
- **Stale-zone monitor** — separate `StaleZoneChecker` fires **P2** if any
  enabled controller zone or known hose-timer valve (connected or not) hasn't
  run within `stale_zone_days` (default **15**). Daily dedup per zone; hourly
  evaluation gate.
  Catches: schedule accidentally disabled, hose-timer hub offline, dead
  valve battery, etc.
- **Report failures escalate to Pushover** — weekly-email failure (e.g.
  Gmail auth error) fires P1 Pushover so you know immediately.

```bash
# Dry-run all rules against live Flume / Rachio (no Pushover sent)
uv run python RachioFlume/rfmanager.py alerts test

# Show per-rule state
uv run python RachioFlume/rfmanager.py alerts status

# Mute a rule (e.g. while doing plumbing work)
uv run python RachioFlume/rfmanager.py alerts mute "Pipe Break" --hours 4
uv run python RachioFlume/rfmanager.py alerts unmute "Pipe Break"
```

### 🔁 DB Replay — validate alerts against real data

Replay production `water_readings` + `watering_events` through the alert
engine without hitting Flume/Rachio APIs or sending Pushover. Useful for
verifying logic changes don't false-trigger on real data, and for tuning
predicates.

Two patterns:

```bash
# 1. Replay against the LOCAL DB (whatever's in your config path)
uv run python RachioFlume/rfmanager.py alerts replay --hours 168   # 7 days

# 2. Replay against a COPY of the prod DB (safest — no risk of writes to prod)
scp <user>@<prod-host>:~/logs/water_tracking.db /tmp/prod_water_tracking.db
uv run python RachioFlume/rfmanager.py alerts replay \
    --hours 168 --db /tmp/prod_water_tracking.db
```

Output is tab-aligned and shows the new label set: `REPORT` (P-2), `FIRE` (P2),
`CLEAR` (P0). Suppressed cycles are summarized at the bottom (the suppression
window includes both controller and hose-timer activity).

A clean 7-day replay against current prod data should produce ~24 `Zone Report`
entries (12 active zones × 2 cycles/week) and zero false `Pipe Break` / `Leak`
fires while irrigation is active.

### 🌐 Remote test loop on the test host

Build locally, test remotely — without touching the running prod collector.

```bash
# From a feature branch on your local machine
./RachioFlume/scripts/remote-test.sh                                  # push + deploy + live dry-run + 24h replay
./RachioFlume/scripts/remote-test.sh --replay-hours 168                # replay 7 days instead of 24h
./RachioFlume/scripts/remote-test.sh --hot                             # restart prod collector after tests
```

One-time setup on the test host (uses `~/Code-test` so prod `~/Code` is safe):
```bash
ssh <test-host> "git clone https://github.com/abutala/homely-vibes ~/Code-test && cd ~/Code-test && uv sync --quiet"
ssh <test-host> "ln -sf ~/Code/config/local.yaml ~/Code-test/config/local.yaml"
```

### 🧪 Synthetic Scenarios (unit tests only)

Hand-crafted scenarios (pipe break, slow leak, irrigation-overlap-leak, etc.)
live in [test_alert_simulation.py](test_alert_simulation.py) as pytest
assertions — built in-code via `SyntheticDataset.add_*` builders from
[synthetic_data.py](synthetic_data.py). No YAML, no separate CLI verb —
running `make test` exercises them.

The simulator's AlertEngine is constructed against the real merged config
(`default.yaml` + `local.yaml`), so a scenario run is also an integration
test of the config shape your production collector uses. See
[TESTABILITY.md](TESTABILITY.md) for the scenario taxonomy + assertions.

### 🛑 Stop Data Collection

```bash
# Find the background process
ps aux | grep "rfmanager.py collect"

# Stop it
kill <process_id>

# Or if running in foreground, just use Ctrl+C
```

## Architecture

### Components

1. **RachioClient** (`rachio_client.py`)
   - Interfaces with Rachio API
   - Retrieves zone information and watering events
   - Monitors active watering sessions

2. **FlumeClient** (`flume_client.py`)
   - Interfaces with Flume API using OAuth2 JWT authentication
   - Automatically discovers and queries all user devices
   - Aggregates water usage readings across multiple devices
   - Provides current flow rate data

3. **WaterTrackingDB** (`data_storage.py`)
   - SQLite database for persistent storage
   - Stores zones, events, readings, and computed sessions
   - Events are keyed on `(event_date, zone_number, event_type)` and readings on `timestamp`: a re-fetched event is ignored, a re-fetched reading replaces the stored value
   - Rebuilds `zone_sessions` every cycle. A START is closed by the next controller event; if that isn't the zone's own end event, the end was lost and is estimated from Flume flow (a run with no visible flow is kept as zero-length)

4. **WaterTrackingCollector** (`collector.py`)
   - Orchestrates data collection from both APIs
   - Runs continuously or on-demand
   - Re-fetches the last `FETCH_OVERLAP` of both feeds every poll, because both publish late

5. **WeeklyReporter** (`reporter.py`)
   - Generates period reports with customizable date ranges (default 7 days)
   - Unified `ZoneStats` table covers controller zones and hose valves; hose entries sort after controllers via `HOSE_ZONE_SENTINEL=999`
   - Per-zone anomaly `threshold_gpm` and `alert_sessions` count surfaced alongside the aggregate stats
   - Supports HTML email delivery (via `<html><body><pre>` — auto-detected by `lib.Mailer`) and console output

6. **AlertEngine** (`alert_engine.py`) + **AlertRule** (`alert_rules.py`)
   - Runs at the end of each collector cycle
   - **Zone-end reporting**: detects when a Rachio zone finishes, waits for slack, sends one P-2 (silent) report per zone *per cycle* — no per-day dedup; the message carries a cycle counter so repeat runs are distinguishable. Includes runtime, avg GPM, total gallons
   - **Zone anomaly detection**: checks zone-end flow against per-zone thresholds (configured in `config/default.yaml` under `rachio_flume.alerts.zone_thresholds`). Alerts at P2 when flow exceeds `avg + max(0.5 GPM, 10% of avg)`. Unknown zones default to 0.5 GPM threshold.
   - **Anomaly rules**: evaluates each rule's predicate against trailing per-minute Flume readings — requires mean ≥ threshold AND CV ≤ max_cv (coefficient-of-variation filter rejects spiky noise)
   - Anomaly fires at P2 (emergency), at most once per day per rule; P0 clear on active→clear
   - Suppressed during (and just after) Rachio irrigation
   - Per-rule and per-zone reported-today state persisted as JSON in `collection_metadata`

7. **SyntheticDataset** (`synthetic_data.py`) + **Simulator** (`simulate_alerts.py`)
   - In-code scenarios (household, irrigation, leak, pipe-break) built via `SyntheticDataset.add_*` helpers
   - Plays back through `AlertEngine` with fake clients and a capturing Pushover
   - Used by `test_alert_simulation.py` for regression assertions
   - Ad-hoc replay of historical DB uses `rfmanager.py alerts replay` (see § DB Replay)

### Database Schema

- **zones**: Zone configuration and metadata
- **watering_events**: Raw events from Rachio API
- **water_readings**: Time-series usage data from Flume
- **zone_sessions**: Computed watering sessions with usage correlation

## API Rate Limits

- **Rachio**: 1,700 calls/day rate limit
- **Flume**: Check your plan's API limits

The collector is designed to respect these limits with configurable polling intervals.

## Example Output

### Period Report

Controllers and hose valves land in the same fixed-width table. `Thr` is the
per-zone anomaly threshold (blank when unconfigured); `Alrt` is the count of
sessions in the period whose per-session avg flow exceeded that threshold.
Emailed variant wraps this body in `<html><body><pre>` so iOS Mail / Gmail
render the whole table in monospace with no viewport wrap.

## Testing

See [TESTABILITY.md](TESTABILITY.md) for the full testing strategy. Quick start:

```bash
# All RachioFlume tests
uv run python -m pytest RachioFlume/ -v

# Just alert engine unit tests (fastest)
uv run python -m pytest RachioFlume/test_alert_engine.py -v

# Synthetic scenario assertions
uv run python -m pytest RachioFlume/test_alert_simulation.py -v

# Zone threshold integration test (fetches DB from prod controller)
uv run python -m pytest RachioFlume/test_zone_thresholds.py -v
# Or standalone:
python RachioFlume/test_zone_thresholds.py

# Replay historical DB through the alert engine (no Pushover)
uv run python RachioFlume/rfmanager.py alerts replay --hours 168
```

### Zone Threshold Integration Test

The `test_zone_thresholds.py` integration test validates the zone anomaly detection logic against production data:

1. **Fetches the production database** from prod controller via SCP
2. **Loads zone thresholds** from config (12 zones with per-zone avg GPM)
3. **Tests threshold computation** for known/unknown zones
4. **Simulates zone-end scenarios** with real historical data
5. **Checks for threshold violations** in recent production sessions

**Threshold formula** (adaptive mode):
```
threshold = avg_gpm + max(absolute_gpm, percent_above/100 × avg_gpm)
```

Actual baselines live in `config/local.yaml` under
`rachio_flume.alerts.zone_anomaly.zone_thresholds` — see the file for
current per-zone `avg_gpm` values and their tuning notes. **Unknown zones**
(not in config) default to `avg_gpm=0`, yielding a 0.5 GPM threshold — any
flow triggers an alert.

**Config key convention**: controllers key by stringified `zone_number`, hose
valves by their raw API name. Why, and how display strings are derived:
[Logbook.md](Logbook.md).

**Requirements**: SSH access to prod controller (configured in `config/local.yaml`) must work without password prompt (key-based auth).

## Development

The integration follows the existing project patterns:
- Uses pydantic for data models
- Implements proper error handling
- Includes comprehensive logging
- Supports async operations where beneficial
- Maintains clean separation of concerns
