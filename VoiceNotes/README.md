# VoiceNotes — Local Push-to-Talk Voice Transcription

Gotchas, incidents and error reference: [Logbook.md](Logbook.md).

A Wispr Flow-style voice-to-Markdown tool for macOS Apple Silicon. Hold **⌥ right**, speak, release — phrases are transcribed and streamed to a per-session Markdown file in real time.

**Fully local.** No cloud. Uses [whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp) with Metal GPU acceleration via [pywhispercpp](https://github.com/abdeladim-s/pywhispercpp).

## Features

- **Push-to-talk** — hold a key, speak, release. Configurable hotkey (default: ⌥ right)
- **Phrase-level streaming** — webrtcvad detects speech boundaries; each phrase is transcribed and written within ~400ms of the pause that ends it
- **Per-session files** — `~/bin/knowledge/notes/YYYY-MM-DDThh-mm.md`, one file per recording, line-buffered for live `tail -f`
- **Menu-bar UI** — 🎙 idle / 🔴 recording / ✅ saved
- **Apple Silicon optimized** — Metal GPU + unified memory; large-v3-turbo runs at ~2.7× real-time on M2 8GB
- **No mocks in tests** — `stream_factory` and `vad_factory` constructor params keep tests free of monkey-patching

                                                │
Release ⌥right → stop_recording → flush final phrase → close file

## Setup

### Install voice dependencies

```bash
uv sync --extra voice 2>&1 | tee /tmp/voice_notes_install.log
```

This installs:
- `pywhispercpp` (whisper.cpp Python bindings, Metal-accelerated)
- `sounddevice` (audio capture via PortAudio)
- `webrtcvad-wheels` (Google's WebRTC Voice Activity Detection)
- `rumps` (macOS menu-bar app framework)
- `pynput` (global hotkey listener)

### Grant macOS permissions

First-run requires two permissions in **System Settings → Privacy & Security**:

1. **Accessibility** → add Terminal (or your terminal app) — required for the global hotkey
2. **Microphone** → add Terminal — required for audio capture

### Run

```bash
uv run python VoiceNotes/voice_notes.py 2>&1 | tee /tmp/voice_notes.log
```

A 🎙 icon appears in your menu bar. Hold ⌥ right and start talking.

> **First run downloads a 1.5 GB whisper.cpp model** (`large-v3-turbo`) from Hugging Face to `~/Library/Application Support/pywhispercpp/models/`. Subsequent runs load it from disk in ~2s.

## Usage

| Action | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| Hold ⌥ right | Menu bar shows 🔴 Recording... — audio is being captured |
| Speak, pause, speak | Each phrase is transcribed and appended to the session file as soon as VAD detects the pause |
| Release ⌥ right | Final phrase flushed, session file closed with `---` separator, menu bar shows ✅ Saved |
| Menu → **Open notes folder** | Opens `~/bin/knowledge/notes/` in Finder |
| Menu → **Show last session** | Opens the most recent `.md` in your default editor |

### Watch transcription live

```bash
tail -f ~/bin/knowledge/notes/$(ls -t ~/bin/knowledge/notes/ | head -1)
```

The file is line-buffered (`buffering=1`), so VSCode / Obsidian / `tail -f` see each phrase the moment it's written.

## Configuration

Defaults live in [`config/default.yaml`](../config/default.yaml). Override in `config/local.yaml`:

```yaml
voice_notes:
  model_id: "large-v3-turbo"          # whisper.cpp model name
  hotkey: "right_option"               # right_option | left_option | f5 | f13 | ...
  notes_dir: "~/bin/knowledge/notes"
  sample_rate: 16000                   # Hz (whisper.cpp requirement)
  channels: 1                          # mono
  vad_aggressiveness: 2                # 0 (least) – 3 (most aggressive silence detection)
  n_threads: 4                         # CPU threads; Metal GPU used automatically
```

### Tuning the model

| Model              | Size   | Latency (M2) | Notes                               |
|--------------------|--------|-------------|-------------------------------------|
| `large-v3-turbo`   | 1.6 GB | ~400ms      | **Recommended** — best accuracy     |
| `medium`           | 1.5 GB | ~250ms      | Good balance                        |
| `small`            | 488 MB | ~100ms      | Faster, lower accuracy              |
| `base`             | 145 MB | ~50ms       | Near-real-time, basic quality       |

### Tuning VAD aggressiveness

- `0` — permissive: keeps more audio, fewer missed words, more false phrases
- `2` — balanced (default): good for normal speech in quiet environments
- `3` — aggressive: cuts through noise; may clip sentence starts in loud rooms
