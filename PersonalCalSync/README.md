# Personal Calendar Sync

Gotchas, incidents and error reference: [Logbook.md](Logbook.md).

Syncs personal Google Calendar events to your enterprise Google Calendar as private busy-blocker events (tomato colored). Prevents coworkers from booking over your personal commitments.

## How it works

- Fetches your personal calendar via its secret iCal URL (HTTP, bypasses enterprise restrictions)
- Parses ICS format including RRULE expansion for recurring events
- Creates/updates/deletes blocker events on your enterprise calendar using the **real event title** from your personal calendar
- Blocker events are marked `PRIVATE` — coworkers see "Busy", only you see the title
- **Preserves free/busy + RSVP intent**: events you marked "Free" (`TRANSP:TRANSPARENT`) sync as **Free** (visible to you, but coworkers can still book over them); "Maybe"/tentative events sync as **Tentative**
- Skips declined events and cancelled instances
- Batches writes to avoid Google API rate limits
- Runs every 15 minutes via Apps Script trigger

## Setup

### 1. Get your secret iCal URL

1. Open [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com) logged in as your **personal** account
2. Settings (gear) → click your calendar name in the left sidebar
3. Scroll to **"Integrate calendar"**
4. Copy **"Secret address in iCal format"** (NOT the public one)

### 2. Create the Apps Script project

1. Open [script.google.com](https://script.google.com) logged in as your **enterprise** account
2. New Project → delete placeholder code
3. Paste contents of `calendar-sync.gs`
4. Save

### 3. Store the iCal URL in Script Properties

The URL is stored in Apps Script's encrypted Script Properties — not in the code — so it survives future `clasp push` deployments.

1. In the Apps Script editor → **Project Settings** (gear icon on left) → **Script Properties**
2. Click **Add script property**
3. Property: `PERSONAL_ICAL_URL` — Value: your secret iCal URL from step 1
4. Add a second property: `MY_EMAIL` — Value: your personal email address. Used to match your own RSVP (`PARTSTAT`) so declined events are skipped and "Maybe" events sync as Tentative. Kept in Script Properties rather than source code so no PII is committed to git.
5. Click **Save script properties**

Also save it in `config/local.yaml` (gitignored) so it's backed up locally:
```yaml
personal_cal_sync:
  ical_url: "your_secret_ical_url_here"
```

### 4. Run initial sync

1. Select `initialSync` from the function dropdown → click **Run**
2. Approve calendar permissions when prompted
3. Check your enterprise calendar for red blocker events

### 5. Set up automatic sync

1. Left sidebar → **Triggers** (clock icon) → **Add Trigger**
2. Function: `syncCalendar`
3. Event source: Time-driven
4. Type: Minutes timer
5. Interval: Every 15 minutes
6. Save

## Deploying updates

After initial setup, use [`clasp`](https://github.com/google/clasp) to push local edits without copy-pasting.

### One-time clasp setup

**1. Install clasp:**

```bash
npm install -g @google/clasp
```

**2. Enable the Apps Script API** on your enterprise account:

Visit [script.google.com/home/usersettings](https://script.google.com/home/usersettings) and toggle **Google Apps Script API** to **On**. Without this, `clasp push` will fail with a 403. Only needed once per Google account.

**3. Log in** (opens browser — sign in as your **enterprise** Google account, the one that owns the Apps Script project):

```bash
clasp login
```

Credentials are saved to `~/.clasprc.json`. You only need to do this once per machine.

**4. Find your Script ID:** `script.google.com` → your project → **Project Settings** → **IDs** → Script ID.

**5. Store it in `config/local.yaml`** (gitignored) so Claude can run deploys for you without being asked:

```yaml
personal_cal_sync:
  script_id: "your_script_id_here"
```

**6. Link this directory** to your Apps Script project:

```bash
cd PersonalCalSync
clasp clone <SCRIPT_ID>   # same ID as above
```

This creates `.clasp.json` (gitignored — contains your script ID) and `appsscript.json`.

### Pushing changes

```bash
cd PersonalCalSync
clasp push        # uploads calendar-sync.gs to Apps Script
```

To trigger an immediate sync after pushing (instead of waiting for the 15-minute timer), open the Apps Script editor, select `initialSync` from the function dropdown, and click **Run**.

### `.clasp.json` and secrets

`.clasp.json` contains the script ID (not sensitive) but no credentials. The iCal URL lives in Apps Script's Script Properties (encrypted, never in source code) and in `config/local.yaml` (gitignored) as a local backup.

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `PERSONAL_ICAL_URL` | — | Secret iCal URL — stored in Script Properties, not source code |
| `MY_EMAIL` | — | Your personal email — stored in Script Properties, not source code. Matches your own RSVP for declined/tentative handling |
| `BLOCKER_TITLE_FALLBACK` | `Personal (Busy)` | Title used only if SUMMARY is missing from iCal |
| `SYNC_DAYS_AHEAD` | `180` | How far ahead to sync |
| `BATCH_SIZE` | `10` | Events created before pausing |
| `BATCH_PAUSE_MS` | `2000` | Pause duration between batches (ms) |

## Utility functions

| Function | Description |
|---|---|
| `initialSync()` | One-time full sync with logging |
| `syncCalendar()` | Standard sync (used by trigger) |
| `cleanupAllBlockers()` | Remove all synced blocker events |

## Privacy model

| Who sees what | Value |
|---|---|
| You (calendar owner) | Real event title (e.g. "Doctor appt") |
| Coworkers scheduling you | "Busy" only — no title, no details |
| Coworkers with full calendar access | Still sees "Busy" (PRIVATE visibility) |

The secret iCal URL grants read-only access to your personal calendar. Do not share it or commit it to a public repo.
